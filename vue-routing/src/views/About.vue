      Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects.
      He later summed up his thought process: "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that
      I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight."[16] The first source
      code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following
      February, in 2014.
